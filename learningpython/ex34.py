animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

# The animal at 1 where is that, in python the first starts with a '0'
print animals[0] # bear would be the 'first' animal 0 = first index
print animals[2] # what is the 3rd animal?
print animals[1] # The animal at 1, would be a python
print animals[5] # platypus
print animals[-1] # platypus, last index is also -1, going left would -1 more
